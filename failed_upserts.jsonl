{"item": {"title": "Distributed Generation Energy Project Financing", "program_status": "OPEN", "program_deadline": null, "program_overview": "The RUS Electric Program can provide loans and loan guarantees to energy project developers for distributed energy projects including renewables that provide wholesale or retail electricity to existing Electric Program borrowers or to rural communities served by other utilities. Electric Program project financing loans follow the same regulatory requirements and processes as do our traditional electric infrastructure loans and loan guarantees (also known as system loans or loans for rural electrification).\nDistributed generation projects including generation from renewable resources are providing more power supply options for rural communities.  There is growing interest among electric cooperatives to enter into power purchase agreements (PPAs) with project developers or to interconnect distributed generation projects directly into their systems.\nWho may apply for financing?\nEnergy project developers for distributed energy projects\nElectric Program borrowers or other utilities that serve rural areas\nHow may funds be used?\nFor project loans, there are three typical situations:\nExisting borrower (cooperative) owns and operates the project.\nA project developer builds and operates the project that has PPAs to serve rural customers such as existing RUS borrowers and/or other off-takers.\nA wholly-owned subsidiary of an existing RUS borrower owns and operates the project and has a PPA with the RUS borrower to take the entire output.\nExisting borrower (cooperative) owns and operates the project\nThis situation is treated just like a traditional system loan where the cooperative owns the project and it is an addition to its utility plant.\nA project developer builds and operates the project that has a PPA to serve rural customers such as an existing RUS borrower and/or other off-takers\nIn this scenario, the project developer/owner is the RUS borrower and the loan underwriting and security requirements include, but are not limited, to the following:\nEquity:  RUS requires a minimum of 25% cash equity at the start of the project.  We want the equity to remain at 25 to 30% through the life of the project (over the 10 year LRFF).  The maximum RUS loan amount may be up to 75% of the total project costs.\nRurality/PPAs:  The project needs a PPA(s) showing that its output is 100% subscribed and that (all) off takers are rural (places less than 20,000 population by census).  If less than 75% of the offtake power is going to rural beneficiaries, then the RUS loan amount will be limited to that rural percentage.  The borrower will then need more equity or other financing or grants.\nTechnology:  RUS does not take technology risk.  We finance commercial technology.\nEnvironment (NEPA):  The construction timeline needs to accommodate the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review process.  No construction is permitted before the project is cleared via the NEPA process.\nSecurity:  The Electric Program requires risk mitigation measures such as: O&M reserve fund, warranties, guarantees, insurance, RUS debt servicing sinking fund, etc. (in lieu of parent company guarantee, if possible).\nLong-Term Financing: RUS does not provide construction lending.  An RUS project loan is permanent financing that takes out short-term construction financing.\nFinancial Performance Thresholds: In each year in the long range financial forecast (LRFF) (10 years) and during operation, the project is required to meet the following minimum financial ratios, TIER of 1.05 and DSC of 1.0.\nOperation/Performance Conditions: Borrower can advance on an approved and obligated RUS project loan after satisfying a 30 day operational shake-down period and commissioning that proves its performance.  Other loan conditions may need to be satisfied as well.\nTypical loan tenure: 20 years for solar and interest rates are low (about Treasury +1/8).\nThere may be additional conditions placed on the loan and loan advances depending on the actual specific details regarding the borrower and the project.\nA wholly-owned subsidiary of an existing RUS borrower owns and operates the project and has a PPA with the RUS borrower to take the entire output\nIn this scenario, a subsidiary of an RUS borrower is the owner and new RUS borrower.

{"item": {"title": "Energy Efficiency and Conservation Loan Program", "program_status": "OPEN", "program_deadline": null, "program_overview": "What does this program do?\nThe Energy Efficiency and Conservation Loan Program (EECLP) provides loans to finance energy efficiency and conservation projects for commercial, industrial, and residential consumers. With the EECLP, eligible utilities, including existing Rural Utilities Service borrowers can borrow money tied to Treasury rates of interest and re-lend the money to develop new and diverse energy service products within their service territories. For instance, borrowers could set up on-bill financing programs whereby customers in their service territories implement energy efficiency measures behind the meter and repay the loan to the distribution utility through their electric bills.\nWho may apply?\nLoans under the EECLP are available to those businesses (utility systems) that have direct or indirect responsibility for providing retail electric service to persons in a rural area.  In general, a rural area for EECLP purposes is a town, or unincorporated area that has a population not greater than 20,000 inhabitants, and any area within a service area of a borrower for which a borrower has an outstanding loan.  Eligible communities can be combined into service territories that exceed 20,000. In other words, the EECLP is available for an entity in the business of providing:\nRetail electric service to consumers,\nWholesale electric supply to distribution entities, or\nTransmission service to distribution or generation entities.\nIn each one of those cases, the entity providing the applicable service would do it with self-owned or controlled assets under a published tariff that the entity and any associated regulatory agency may adjust.\nWhat are the terms of these loans?\nThe maximum term for loans under the EECLP is 15 years, unless the funding relates to ground-source loop investments or technology on an aggregate basis with a useful life greater than 15 years.\nWhat is an eligible area?\nThe law requires the consideration of several factors to determine whether an area qualifies as rural for the purposes of this program.\n We encourage you to contact your General Field Representative (GFR) to determine if your program would serve a qualified rural area.\nHow may the funds be used?\nThe EECLP allows borrowers to design their EE Programs.   While RUS does not establish specific energy efficiency program designs, the program does require that funding be used to:\nImprove energy efficiency and/or reduce peak demand on the customer side of the meter;\nModify the electric load such that there is a reduction in overall system demand;\nStimulate a more efficient use of existing electric facilities;\nAttract new business and create jobs in rural communities by investing in energy efficiency, and/or\nEncourage the use of renewable energy fuels for demand-side management or to reduce the use of fossil fuel use within a service territory.\nWhat is an eligible investment or activity under the EELCP?\nIn addition to energy efficiency measures, EECLP funds could be used to:\nAll energy efficiency measures on a consumer premises\nDistributed generation for on or off grid renewable energy systems\nDemand side management investments\nEnergy audits\nConsumer education and outreach programs\nPower factor correction equipment on the consumer side of the meter\nRe-lamping to more energy efficient lighting\nOther energy efficiency program investments approved by RUS Residential and commercial energy audits\nCommunity awareness and outreach programs\nHow do we get started?\nWe encourage you to contact your General Field Representative (GFR) to begin the loan application process.\nRUS accepts applications for these programs year-round.\nWho can answer questions about this program?\nContact the GFR who serves your area\nContact the Rural Electric Program\u2019s Office of Loan Origination and Approval (OLOA)\nWhat governs this program?\nRural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended in 7 U.S.C. 901\nFinal Rule\nWhy does USDA Rural Development do this?\nNearly every rural electric cooperative utility nationwide has some form of energy efficiency program as part of their strategy to manage power costs, meet consumer demand and increase environmental regulatory compliance.

With access to RA as a steady source of project revenue, owners can leverage other public and private financing sources for project rehabilitation.\nWith more than 400,000 apartment units nationwide, the MFH program is a crucial source of affordable housing for rural communities. More than 80 percent of the tenants living in USDA-funded multifamily units rely on USDA RD rental assistance to keep their housing affordable.\nThe MFH program is facing an accelerated loss of affordable housing projects in its portfolio. Between now and 2034, roughly 27 percent of the units in the current MFH portfolio could exit the program as their mortgages mature. More than 94 percent will be eligible to pay off their loans by 2050, reflecting the potential loss of about 333,000 multifamily apartments.\nIn July 2023, we conducted Congressionally mandated listening sessions for input regarding the necessary resources, tools and policies to successfully implement decoupling. Participating stakeholders were overwhelmingly supportive of decoupling.\nWho is eligible to apply for a SARA contract ?\nThe 2024 Consolidated Appropriations Act, amended (Public Law 118-42, available at this link: tinyurl.com/PubLaw11842 ) authorized USDA Rural Development to contract up to 1,000 RA units from maturing mortgage properties during Fiscal Year 2024. The 2025 Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act extended this authority to Fiscal Year 2025.\nWe have notified eligible borrowers with MFH direct loans maturing between March 9, 2024, and September 30, 2025. These borrowers can apply for a SARA contract with minimum and maximum terms of 10 and 20 years, respectively. If the borrower has more than one loan on the property, all associated USDA Rural Development MFH loans must have maturity dates earlier than September 30, 2025.\nThe decoupling authority is not available to owners or borrowers who submitted a final loan payment that already has been processed by USDA Rural Development. Additionally, SARA contracts are not available to borrowers through a prepayment process, nor in conjunction with other servicing actions.\nWhat is the status of the SARA decoupling authority for future years?\nThe current decoupling authority ends September 30, 2025. We are actively seeking decoupling authority for future years.\nWhat if I do not want to enter into a SARA contract?\nParticipation in SARA is voluntary. Even if you choose not to participate, you can still pay your maturing mortgage loan in full, with the understanding that RA will end once we process your final loan payment.\nExisting tenants will be offered USDA RD vouchers, which can be used to supplement rental payments (information available at this link: tinyurl.com/MFHVoucher).\nHow do we get started?\nFor additional information and help, please email SM.RD.Decoupling@usda.gov.\nWhen can we expect more information?\nThose eligible to apply for a SARA contract in FY24 and FY25 received direct notice in August 2024 and March 2025 respectively.\nIf authority is granted for Fiscal Year 2026, we will publish a notice in the Federal Register.", "program_overview_link": null, "program_apply": "", "program_requirements": null, "program_contact": null, "program_contact_link": null, "program_events": ""}, "error": "Collection objects do not implement truth value testing or bool().
