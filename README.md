PROBLEM STATEMENT
USDA Rural Development Chatbot: Develop a public-facing AI chatbot designed to provide information about USDA Rural Development programs and their eligibility criteria. This chatbot will streamline public interactions with RD Programs.
Users should be able to describe their situation, and the chatbot will suggest relevant RD programs, including links to the appropriate pages.
Additionally, it will answer basic questions about the programs using publicly available data and offer contact information or next steps for potential applicants.
Participants will gain experience in curating knowledge bases, exploring different methods of LLM data ingestion + QA (Cache-augmented generation, retrieval-augmented generation, etc.), as well as potentially employing a frontend UI.
